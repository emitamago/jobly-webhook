# jobly-webhook
small webhook server inspired by school exercise

### About this project
During company project, i had opportunity to work with webhook server. I was very excited to learn 
how to handle webhook with our api. And I decided to build small webhook to understand more.

### Inspiration
I used some of code from solution code that [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/) provided us.
